This plugin aims to bring first class support for the JACK Audio
Connection Kit to VCV Rack.

* Modules
** JACK Audio

- There are four input and four output ports.
- Output ports are marked with an off-color accent.
- Each port may be named individually, and the name supplied in Rack
  will appear in your JACK patch bay.
- Each name must be unique across an entire Rack instance.
- If four ports are not enough, simply add more to a patch. Each
  module will create four input and output ports. All modules
  cooperate to ensure that audio is sent and received through JACK in
  lockstep (you can consult the power meter to see that only one of
  the JACK Audio modules will stall Rack.)

Note that Rack works on a per-sample basis, and JACK works on a
per-batch basis. We also do not convey latency information to JACK
currently. This means you will notice a delay from audio signals that
do not pass through Rack from signals that do.

*** TODO Latency information
JACK supports reporting the latency of a client, ostensibly to help
other clients match up with one another and prevent sample delays. We
currently do not report latency information to JACK.

*** TODO Combining with other Audio Modules
There are known issues combining JACK Audio with other Audio plugins,
such as from Fundamental or the Audio16 module from RMS. 

** TODO Clock
** TODO MIDI

* Licenses

** Graphics
The (upcoming) enhanced graphics were designed by github user
[[https://github.com/infamedavid][@infamedavid (David Rodriguez)]], and are available via CC-BY.

** SkJACK
This plugin is made available under BSD-3.

** JACK
A copy of the JACK client headers are included under =src/jack=, which
are made available to us under the LGPL license.

We have included them because it primarily simplifies compiling the
plugin on Windows (MinGW2) targets.
